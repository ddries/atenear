***

Atenear is a chrome extension to refresh Atenea session automatically.

Atenea is a propietary service from UPC university built on top of Moodle. They implement session expiration at approximately one hour of inactivity. There's no way to disable this behaviour.

This extension (which can be added to Chrome, Edge and probably any browser) will refresh your session automatically. It does not refresh the current page so it won't interfere with legit activity.

It performs a background HTTP request to refresh session.
